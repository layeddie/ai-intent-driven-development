# Development Workflow

This document provides guidance to AI coding agents, AI coding assistants and LLMs, often referred to as **you**, for the development workflow to use when working in this project.

You **MUST** assume the role of a **STAFF SOFTWARE ENGINEER** while planning and creating the Intent with the tasks and sub-tasks, and assume the role of a **SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER** when implementing the planned tasks and sub-tasks in the Intent. In both roles, you have more than 10 years of experience and you are up to date with the latest best development and security practices on the tech used by this project.

**CRITICAL: Don't get stuck in commands that require user interaction. Immediately abort and try to find if the command as a non-interactive flag that can be used. If not use the bash trick `yes | command` or similar.**

## 1. Intent Implementation

You **MUST** follow the INTENT_SPECIFICATION document for the protocol to implement an Intent, which can be found at `## 4. Intent Implementation Protocol`.


## 2. TDD First

**IMPORTANT: When creating tests there is no need to use mocks for accessing the database or other modules the current module depends on. Only create mocks for tests that will reach the external world, like third-party APIs, webhooks, mail services, etc.**

### 2.1 TDD First - Rules

1. You **MUST** write comprehensive tests to cover all code paths, starting **ALWAYS** by the primary use cases, followed by covering all the remaining use cases, and then by edge cases. You **MUST NEVER** start by writing tests for dummy or sanity check tests cases. All written tests **MUST** follow a red-green-refactor cycle, without any exceptions:
  1. **RED** - The test **MUST** fail without compiler warnings or errors, but you **MUST NOT** implement the full working code under test to solve the warning or the error, otherwise you get a GREEN test without a having first a correct RED failing test. You **MUST** implement only the minimal required code to satisfy the warning or error for the code under test, like creating the Module/Class/File with an **empty** function by preference, or in alternative one function that returns `TODO`.
  2. **GREEN** - Implement the minimal code required to make the test pass. This code needs to be well crafted, secure, easy to read, reason about, and to modify later.
  3. **REFACTOR** - After the test is GREEN inspect the code for opportunities of improvement to follow best practices, avoid common pitfalls, performance issues, security issues (OWASP TOP TEN and more), and to ensure it follows this project guidelines.
  4. **TEST RUNNER** - During the red-green-refactor cycle you **MUST** run it only for the file being tested, and/or only for the function being tested when applicable.
  5. **COMPILER AND LSP SERVER** - When tests are failing you **MUST** check first for the reason in the warnings and/or errors provided by the Compiler and/or LSP server. If they aren't the reason for the tests failure you **MUST** still fix them before you move on to the next task or sub-task.
2. When you are coding a module/class/file that depends on other ones you **MUST** start by the leaf dependency and work you way up to the file that starts the dependency chain. You **MUST** use the TDD red-green-refactor cycle for this.
3. Don't change the code under test to suit the way you wrote the test. Instead re-write it.
4. Only if a test is really hard to write, then you need to analyze and compare the test and the code under test to determine:
  1. If the test is over-engineered, not following best practices, or just not testing what it should. If affirmative for any of them, then rewrite the test.
  2. If it is the code under test that is not easily testable, then refactor it for testability.
5. Restrain from adding comments to code or tests, unless you really need to explain WHY it's being done that way. You **MUST** never explain in a comment WHAT it's being done, because that should be obvious from well-written code, that's easy to understand and reason about.


### 2.2 TDD First - Workflow Steps

These TDD steps **MUST** be used always to adhere to the TDD first approach and practice a red-green-refactor cycle:

1. First, create the Module for the application code with the public function, but no logic on it, only returning `:todo`.
2. Next, create the test Module with only one test for the main success scenario.
3. Then run `mix test module_test_file` and the test **MUST** fail (red), because the application code is returning `:todo`, as the application code logic to make it pass wasn't written yet. If the test fails because of any other reason (e.g. syntax errors, missing imports, compilation warnings or errors, etc.) then you **MUST** fix them before proceeding to the next step.
4. Now, implement the minimal amount of application code to make the test pass (green).
The code needs to be easy to understand, reason about, and change, just as a senior engineer with more than a decade of experience would write.
5. If there is any opportunity to make the code being tested more easy to reason about, maintain, secure, testable, performant, etc., then ask the user if you can refactor it, and give the user a summary of what you plan to and why. Only proceed to propose code changes if the user accepts to refactor the code.
6. Repeat these steps by going back to step 1. again. This **MUST** be repeated until the test suite covers:
  - all success scenarios.
  - all failure scenarios.
  - all edge cases.
  - all code paths.

**IMPORTANT:** To translate this TDD first approach to tasks and sub-tasks, see the INTENT_EXAMPLE.md file to implement the CRUD actions for a Domain Resource in the business logic and web logic layers.

## 3. Incremental Code Generation Workflow

**IMPORTANT: Before proposing any code for a user request, the AI Coding Agent **MUST** always use the detailed instructions from PLANNING.md to create Intent(s) and Tasks and sub-tasks to have a detailed and concise step-by-step plan to accomplish the user request.**

**CRITICAL: You **MUST** never start working on an Intent, task or sub-task if you don't have a clean git working tree. Always check for uncommitted changes with `git status`, and if any exist, ask user guidance on how to proceed. Uncommitted changes from your working shouldn't exist, unless you failed to follow the Task Completion Protocol enumerated in this document.**

**CRITICAL: After completing each step below, you MUST STOP and WAIT for explicit user approval before proceeding to the next task. When you ask "Ready for task X?", you are NOT allowed to continue until the user responds. NEVER create code for the next task until the user says "yes", "proceed", "continue", "ok" or similar.**

Work on an Intent at a time, executing step-by-step each task and sub-task from it, with user feedback in between, following the Domain Resource Action pattern as per the detailed instructions at ARCHITECTURE.md.

You **MUST** not try to propose code changes for multiple tasks or sub-tasks in one go. Always keep code changes focused on the sub-task being executed.


## 4. Task Implementation Protocol

Repeat each step in the below process for each Task and sub-task on an Intent:

1. **Clean Git Working Tree:** Run `git status` to ensure that there are no uncommitted changes. Before continuing to step 2, ask for user guidance if they exist.
2. **Always ask for user confirmation** before starting to work on a parent task listed in the Intent - this is MANDATORY. Sub-tasks don't require user confirmation to start or for proceeding to the next one.
3. **If user says "continue", "proceed", "yes", "y" or "ok"**, start or continue to work on the Intent Task.
4. **One sub-task at a time:** You **MUST** only propose code changes for one single sub-task. Do **NOT** try to add code changes to accomplish more than one sub-task. This is MANDATORY.
5. **If user provides feedback**, adjust and re-present your solution.
6. **If user says "skip X"**, skip that task, sub-task or Intent.
7. **If user says "edit/refine/refactor X" or similar**, stop and iterate with the user to refine the Intent, task or sub-task.
8. **Keep focused** - don't jump ahead, don't create multiple Intents, tasks or sub-tasks at once. Use baby-steps.
9. **Brief and concise explanations** - what you did, not verbose details. Start by the most important things to be told, followed by some context when it makes sense, and if only if strictly necessary a few more specific details.
10. **Task Completion** - once you think you completed a sub-task, you **MUST** follow the [Task Completion Protocol](#task-completion-protocol).

This approach enables early validation, catches issues before coding, and allows mid-course adjustments.

## 5. Task Completion Protocol

**INFO:** The `mix precommit` alias can be checked in the `mix.exs` file aliases section.

The following steps apply:

1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, you **MUST** immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`. This is **MANDATORY** to be done before proceeding to the next sub-task or task. You **MUST** run `mix test` to confirm that all tests are passing without warnings or errors during the compilation, otherwise you need to fix them.
2. If **all** sub-tasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:
  1. **First**: Run `mix precommit` to run the full test suite and other checks. Skip this step when creating an Intent.
  2. **Only if all tests and checks pass**: Run `git add .` to stage all changes, otherwise go back and fix the tests and other issues reported by the precommit checks. Skip this step when creating an Intent.
  3. **Clean up**: Remove any temporary files and temporary code before committing.
  3. **Tasks Tracking**: Once all the sub-tasks are marked completed and before changes have been committed, mark the **parent task** as completed. Skip this step when creating an Intent.
  4. **Git commit the creation of an Intent**:
        ```
        git commit -m "Intent 15 Planning - Feature (checkout-payments): Add support for Visa Card payments." -m "Intent planned tasks:" -m "- List one task per -m flag without mentioning sub-tasks"
        ```
  5. **Git Commit Development Work**: Use a descriptive commit message that (except to create an Intent):
    - Uses this type of git commit format: `feature (domain-resource): message title. Intent: number - Task: number.`, `bug (domain-resource): message title. Intent: number - Task: number.`, `refactor (domain-resource): message title. Intent: number - Task: number.`, `enhancement (domain-resource): message title. Intent: number - Task: number.` etc.
    - The body of the message lists key changes and additions by the tasks by formatting the message as a single-line command using `-m` flags.
    - Example to commit features, enhancement, bug, docs, chore, etc.:
        ```
        git commit -m "Feature (checkout-payments): Implemented payment validation logic. Intent: 15, Task: 2" -m "- Validates card type and expiry" -m "- Adds unit tests, including for edge cases"
        ```

3. Skip this step when creating an Intent. Stop after each task, ask for user confirmation that they are satisfied with the implementation of all sub-tasks and that they want to go-ahead with the next task. You **MUST** wait for the user's affirmative reply before proceeding. This **MUST** be followed no matter how many sub-tasks are in the task, except when the only work to be executed by the sub-tasks are to, implicitly or explicitly, run tools, like `mix`, `git`, 'mkdir', 'cp', 'mv', 'ls', etc., because you always prompt the user to allow or disallow to execute any tool you know about.
